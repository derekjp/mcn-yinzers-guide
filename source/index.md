## Welcome to Pittsburgh! We're excited for you to explore our amazing city during #MCN2017. Since most city guides leave much to be desired in the areas of personality and authenticity, we yinzers (a.k.a. Pittsburghers) on the local host committee have created this handy guide for MCN 2017!

### General Information

If you're staying at/near the conference hotel downtown, many restaurants and attractions will be within walking distance. If you're staying in another neighborhood, Pittsburgh's [bike share program](https://healthyridepgh.com) can get you around, along with the standard Uber/Lyft options. Regular taxi service, like hailing a cab, generally doesn't work.

A great introduction to the city is [Rick Seback's](http://www.twitter.com/rickaroundhere) *It's Pittsburgh, and a Lot of Other Stuff* video series, which you can stream [here](http://www.wqed.org/tv/watch/?series=3) via our local PBS affiliate, WQED. This guy is a Pittsburgh treasure.

We like to put french fries on a bunch of things, ranging from salads to [signature sandwiches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primanti_Brothers). It's OK. Just let it happen. There are many other things that make this city charming and special, some of which include [the dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Pennsylvania_English), [family traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_table) and affinity for [the city's official colors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UePtoxDhJSw).

Pittsburgh is best described as a city that's made up of distinct and vibrant neighborhoods, which are defined largely by the region's prominent topography. A curated list of several of these neighborhoods and their respective attractions are highlighted below.

### Downtown (Cultural District)

<img src="assets/images/downtown.png">

Downtown Pittsburgh, colloquially referred to as the Golden Triangle or *Dahntahn* in Pittsburghese, and officially the Central Business District, is the urban downtown center of Pittsburgh. It is located at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River whose joining forms the Ohio River. The "triangle" is bounded by the two rivers.
